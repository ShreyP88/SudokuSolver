# SudokuSolver
* Quick little sudoku game in order to check answers or play it with immediate feedback. 

## Motivation 
* It was quite annoying for me to find out that after I had solved a sudoku grid, I had misplaced one number and that had led to a series of numbers being in the incorrect position. In order to keep myself sane, I decided to make this sudoku game which gives immediate feedback to the user and has a GUI to make things easier. It was also a good way for me to get some python practice!
